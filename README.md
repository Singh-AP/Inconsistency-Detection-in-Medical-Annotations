# Inconsistency-Detection-in-Medical-Annotations
It's one of the problems given by ezDI Inc. during Smart India Hackathon 2019.

#Problem Statemnt:
Text in clinical documents is annotated to tag the words or phrases asproblems, diagnoses, procedures, drugs etc and identify the relationshipbetween them. Semantically similar words can be annotated differentlyby different annotators due to ambiguity in understanding the guidelines,incomplete experience or human errors. Identifying inconsistencies canhelp in improving the data quality You need to develop a tool to displaythese similar entities which have different patterns of annotations
  

Source code of the project will be open sourced in March 2019.
